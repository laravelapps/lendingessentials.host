    Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("the Company," "we,"
    or "us"). By accessing or using our web site at www.Lendingclub.com,
    including any subdomain thereof (the "Site"), you (the
    "User") signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound
    by these terms of use ("Terms of Use"), regardless of whether you 
are
    a registered member of the Service. In addition to these Terms of 
Use, you may
    enter into other agreements with us or others that will govern your 
use of the
    Service or related services offered by us or others. If there is any
    contradiction between these Terms of Use and another agreement you 
enter into
    applicable to specific aspects of the Service, the other agreement 
shall take
    precedence in relation to the specific aspects of the Service to 
which it
    applies. As used herein, "Users" means anyone who accesses and/or
    uses the Site.  For any terms herein applicable to all Users, all 
applicants, whether individually or jointly, all investor members, or 
business and other entity Users specifically, or where the context
    otherwise requires, "Users" shall be deemed to include any business 
or other entity
    on behalf of which the Site or Service is accessed by any other 
User, and "you"
    shall be deemed to include any such business or other entity and any
